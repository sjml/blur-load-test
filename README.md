# Blur Load Tester

I was intrigued by the way [Medium](https://jmperezperez.com/medium-image-progressive-loading-placeholder/) and [Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/2015/08/06/android/the-technology-behind-preview-photos/) use blurred
preview images while the larger versions are loading. It's pretty clever
â€” with a small enough preview image, it becomes reasonable to send it as
a data element in the HTML itself instead of triggering another load.
And with enough blurring, the artifacts from the super small image file
aren't visible.

So I ended up curious about optimal image compression for such a thing.
I figured it would be different at different display sizes of the actual
image, but wanted to see for myself. JPEG is not the ideal choice for
images this small â€” it has a fixed overhead that usually is negligible
but becomes a real factor when you're looking at just a few hundred
bytes. WebP is actually great, getting down to just a hundred bytes or
so with decent visual quality, but it's only supported in Safari on
macOS >= Big Sur. ðŸ˜• Other formats might be promising, but nothing has
as broad support as JPEG. So here we are.

Facebook went through the effort of identifying the common sections of
the compressed JPEG header so they could save an additional 20 bytes or
soâ€¦ I'm not quite that interested in hyper-optimization, but of course
there's almost always a little more space to trim.

Caveats:

-   This page doesn't do any checking about what image types your
    browser supports, so if you choose one of the exotic ones and all
    the blurred images disappear, that's why. (The usual solution to
    that problem, [`srcset`](https://caniuse.com/srcset), doesn't work 
    with data attributes, understandably.)
-   Larger display sizes usually need a stronger blur to help cover the 
    compression artifacts, and thus reveal some of the problems around 
    non-standard aspect ratios. Looks like the blur scaling might need 
    to be custom-fitted.
    -   (I would guess this is why Medium does their version the blur in
        a canvas element. Might try to mock up a version that does that.
        But maybe not; I was more interested in testing different
        compression strategies for a longer-term project that I kind of
        want to get back to.)
-   The controls take up too much space on phones. Sorry; this is meant
    more for desktop use where you can get a good look at the visual
    tradeoffs, not on mobile where the data tradeoffs are more useful.
